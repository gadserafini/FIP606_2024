## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
summary(pressure)
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
df <- cars
cars
df$dist
df$dist2 <- c(1:50)

library(tidyverse)

df |> 
  mutate(dist3 = dist2+1) |> 
  select(4)




```

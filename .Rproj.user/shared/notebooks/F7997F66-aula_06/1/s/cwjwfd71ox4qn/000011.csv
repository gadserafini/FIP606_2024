"1","Effect sizes were labelled following Cohen's (1988) recommendations.

The Welch Two Sample t-test testing the difference between mg2$Mg2 and
mg2$control (mean of x = 10.52, mean of y = 15.68) suggests that the
effect is negative, statistically significant, and large (difference =
-5.16, 95% CI [-6.49, -3.83], t(17.35) = -8.15, p < .001; Cohen's d =
-3.65, 95% CI [-5.12, -2.14])
